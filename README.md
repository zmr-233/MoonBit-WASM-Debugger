# MoonBit WASM Debugger (Unofficial)

## What’s MoonBit WASM Debugger

**MoonBit WASM Debugger** is an unofficial VSCode extension that enhances your debugging experience with MoonBit by providing precise line-number error displays for WASM errors. No more untraceable unwraps! It works alongside the official MoonBit plugin to make debugging a breeze.

## Features

- Transforms cryptic WASM stack traces into readable error messages with accurate file names and line numbers.
- Seamlessly integrates with VSCode's Problems panel for quick navigation to error locations.

*(I'll insert two images here showing the error display before and after using the extension.)*

## Usage

To clear the error messages, you can press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type `Clean WASM Errors`, and select the command. Or just wait until the next time you run your code—the errors will update automatically.
